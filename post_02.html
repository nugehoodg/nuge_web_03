    <h1 class="text-3xl font-black font-serif text-center">The Death of my Child</h1>
      <p class="text-justify mt-4 font-serif text-lg leading-relaxed  md:leading-loose">
        My child is gone. My child is somewhere I cannot be. He had an innocent look and beautiful blue eyes, just like yours. People say I need to get over him—to get over someone so dear, to get over someone I gave life to. They want me to move on. My eyes are pitch-black and swollen from countless sleepless nights and endless crying. He was my child, and now he is just a face I see in the corner of my house—a reminder of a certain event. These wounds on my arms don't lie; I have been hurting myself ever since. It is not enough to suffer mentally; I need to hurt myself physically. I know my child wouldn't want that, but a mother knows best, right? With this pen and paper, I am gradually forming a mirror, a reflection of myself for you to see, even though we're far away from each other. Can you recognize me now? Am I still the same woman in your eyes?
<br>
<br>
I've been writing and waiting for a response from you, but I haven’t received anything back. I wonder if you can’t stand me now that he’s gone—or maybe you couldn’t stand me at all back then. Am I just a crazy woman? A worthless human being; not worthy of life, not worthy of love. And yet, I’ve given life and love. I want to live a life full of love. I want to live. Having a son was a miracle, but it has broken my heart. I know he wouldn’t want to hurt his mother’s heart, but he’s such a naughty little critter. Then again, every kid is.
<br>
<br>
Do you remember how he always looked at the sky for long periods of time? I was fascinated, but you were concerned. No, you’re not a bad person—you gave him a chance, a way to go through life without pain. The next day, you bought him ridiculously large sunglasses so he could look at the sky without damaging his eyes. You were always a good father. Have I always been a bad mother? I will never know; you’ve never told me. Perhaps your silence is the answer to that question. Tell me, am I stuck in limbo or purgatory? Why does my back ache every time I wake up—do the pills help? That’s it. If I regularly took the pills, I would’ve come to my senses, and you would’ve responded, right? I am aware—aware that I’m a sick person. I should be ashamed of myself. I don’t want to be sick; I don’t want to grieve. But here I am, and it has been months. You have to trust me that I don't take pleasure in doing these, I feel very lonely, you've left and he has left. Why did you all leave?
<br>
<br>
My life is different now; I guess yours is too. There are big holes scattered everywhere on the floor. I don’t want to fall into one of these holes—the endless abyss they carry is terrifying for one’s conscience. Am I going to go on and on like this? I don’t want to. You just need to respond to my letter, but in case you don’t, I’m going to keep going on and on.
<br>
<br>
I can’t forget him. Every time I walk and every time I breathe, I’m always on the verge of breaking into tears. I don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s the chill in the air, the thought of his face, or the pills I wasn’t taking. What have I done to him? I swear it was for his own good! Now that he’s gone, I bet he’ll appreciate his mother. It’s hard—it’s hard for me to accept the fact. Ever since that accident, I can’t bear to hear a droplet, a splash of water, or even a gush of it. It drives me insane. Yes, that’s right, I’m still sane.
<br>
<br>
Shortly after he was diagnosed with the illness, you started acting differently toward me. You stopped showing me love, but still, I cared for him. You know how hard it was to see him in pain—I know you do—but you had to leave us for work. He was screeching, screaming, and waking up in the middle of the night coughing blood. It was horrible for him. I couldn’t sleep at all, and now that he’s gone, I still can’t sleep. It is a small price to pay as a mother. I just wish you would answer my letters because I cared for our child. He couldn’t eat anything but plain, flavorless porridge. While you were gone, I watched him suffer every day. His life was miserable, and I couldn’t stand hearing him cry in agony. I carried him out to the backyard so he could savor the beauty of the world, hoping that the birds, the clouds, and the greenery would motivate him. And he smiled. It was only a momentary glimpse of happiness, I suppose.
<br>
<br>
While you were gone, we always... it’s hard for me to recount this part of the story. It truly is hard for me. I don’t ever want to unfold this part of the story. But since this is the last time, I’ll do it.
<br>
<br>
Before we were pronounced husband and wife, you and I would talk about the kind of house we wanted to buy. You wanted a house in a quiet suburban neighborhood, and I only wanted a pool in the backyard. However, you couldn’t afford the "quiet" part of the house, but you were able to get a clipper pool for the backyard. We loved that pool so much—you and I were always up for a dip. To escape the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood, we would slowly lower our heads underwater and stay there, embracing each other’s bodies. It wasn’t perfect, but it was our way. Our lives had been full of imperfections—it was the whole world, and God, against us. After a long marriage, it’s improbable for a mother not to want to go on in life without a child of her own. A mother feels as if she’s not worthy of all this love. She’s full of love, and she wants to share that love; it’s only fair for her. When I told you the news, you hugged me in excitement, and I was almost in tears. I love you so much. Although our child was imperfect, you would still support us financially.
<br>
<br>
Our child suffered for far too long, and I couldn’t bear that for him, you know? I had lingering thoughts, and you would slap me across the face, calling me names. I could smell it—you were affected, weren’t you? The smell of alcohol was thick, and I could sense it from miles away. You had become so abusive that I had to wake up quietly and go to the bathroom to cry. I didn’t want that life. You have to understand that I’m not a martyr; I don’t die for somebody else’s sins. Oh, what am I talking about? I’ve been beating around the bush for far too long. The death of my child was not in vain. Sometimes, living in suffering is not the best option, especially when you’re born to suffer at an early age—you still have a long road of suffering ahead. “He was just a child,” that’s what you will say to me, right? That a child is not worthy of death. That a child is not mature enough to choose. That’s what everybody will say. But I am his mother, and I knew that if he were conscious and aware of the situation he was in, he would choose death over everything. For those who judge him—go ahead. Slip into the shoes of my child and tell me, would you not do the same?
<br>
<br>
It was a quiet morning in the neighborhood, strangely quiet. After another sleepless night of caring for him, I finally found a brief moment of peace, though I still needed to care for him. The sun cast its golden light on the green leaves of the trees, the grass glistened with dew, and the pool remained untouched—it was like the first time we stepped into this house.
<br>
<br>
I held him close in my arms, his tiny body so still, his eyes wide open but unfocused. He wasn’t crying. For once, there was no screaming, no coughing, no agony. Just silence. But even that silence felt like a lie.
<br>
<br>
I stood by the pool, gazing into its still waters. Memories of us flooded my mind—how we would laugh and splash, escaping the chaos of the world by submerging ourselves. I could almost feel your arms around me again, holding me underwater, where everything was quiet, perfect for just a moment.
<br>
<br>
I looked down at him and whispered, “Do you remember, sweetheart? Do you remember how peaceful it was?” But he didn’t answer. He only stared back, his lips pale, his face drawn. My heart ached as I realized he’d never known the peace I was speaking of.
<br>
<br>
The water glimmered in the sunlight, so calm it felt unnatural. I wanted him to see beauty, even if for a moment. I lowered myself onto the edge of the pool, dipping my foot into the cold water. It sent a shiver through me, but I ignored it. Slowly, I slid in, holding him tightly against my chest.
<br>
<br>
He couldn’t swim—I knew that. His body was too frail, his limbs too weak. I held him as the water enveloped us, his small feet splashing faintly, sending ripples across the surface. He smiled, just barely, and for a fleeting moment, I felt the warmth of hope.
<br>
<br>
But it was momentary. His smile faded, and his face contorted in the pain that never truly left him. I couldn’t bear it anymore—the knowledge that his suffering outweighed any brief moment of happiness. My chest tightened, my ears rang, and the stillness of the neighborhood pressed down on me.
<br>
<br>
The birds perched silently on the power lines. The air felt heavy, as if the world itself was holding its breath.
<br>
<br>
With trembling hands, I shifted my grip and pressed his head underwater. My entire body shook as he thrashed for just a second, and then—stillness.
<br>
<br>
The water stilled once more, reflecting the unbroken sky. My hand lingered beneath the surface, numb and unfeeling, as my eyes rose to meet the heavens. Tears streamed down my face as I whispered, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
<br>
<br>
I told myself it was for his sake. I couldn’t let him suffer anymore. I wanted to believe it was quick and painless, that he finally found peace. But the silence afterward—it wasn’t the peace I had imagined.
<br>
<br>
It suffocated me.
<br>
<br>
I stayed there, the water lapping against my arms, staring at the pool’s edge where his small body floated. I didn’t move, couldn’t move, as the enormity of what I’d done sank in.
<br>
<br>
Was I selfish? I told myself I wanted to save him, to take away the pain he couldn’t understand. But now I wonder—was it really for him? Or was it to save myself from watching him suffer?
<br>
<br>
The birds flew off, their wings cutting through the stillness. The pool reflected only the emptiness above.
<br>
<br>
Does this make me a monster?
